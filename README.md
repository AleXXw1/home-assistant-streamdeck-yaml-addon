## Add-on Configuration :gear:

There are two ways to configure the add-on:

### Option 1: Using individual configuration parameters

Depending on your setup, the required configuration parameters may vary:

#### Connecting to Home Assistant on the **same machine** as the add-on:

```yaml
streamdeck_config: /config/streamdeck.yaml
```

#### Connecting to Home Assistant on a **different machine**:

```yaml
streamdeck_config: /config/streamdeck.yaml
websocket_protocol: wss
hass_host: 192.168.1.2
hass_token: YOUR_LONG_LIVED_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

The configuration file includes the following parameters:

- üìÑ `streamdeck_config`: The path to your Stream Deck configuration YAML file.
- üîí `websocket_protocol`: The WebSocket protocol to use (`ws` for unsecured, `wss` for secured).
- üè† `hass_host` (optional): The IP address of your Home Assistant instance. If not provided, the add-on will automatically use the IP address of the host running the add-on.
- üîë `hass_token` (optional): The long-lived access token for your Home Assistant instance. If not provided, the add-on will automatically use the Supervisor API token.

### Option 2: Using a `.env` file for configuration

An example add-on configuration using a `.env` file is shown below:

```yaml
streamdeck_dotenv: /config/streamdeck.env
```

The configuration file includes the following parameter:

- `streamdeck_dotenv`: The path to your `.env` file containing the necessary configuration values (e.g., `HASS_HOST`, `HASS_TOKEN`, `STREAMDECK_CONFIG`, and `WEBSOCKET_PROTOCOL`).

‚ö†Ô∏è Note that when specifying an `.env` file, you must include all of the configuration parameters in the `.env` file, and all the other configuration parameters are ignored.
Refer to the [`.env` file example](https://github.com/basnijholt/home-assistant-streamdeck-yaml/blob/main/.env.example) for more details.

## Stream Deck Configuration :video_game:

# Usage üïπÔ∏è
